# Credit Card Credit Score Prediction: Machine Learning Classification
## The Problem Statement and Project Goal:
The project goal of this credit card credit scoring machine learning classification exercise is to discover a combination of data attributes that can be calculated by a credit card issuing company to derive  a Credit Card score that identifies good credit scores and bad credit scores that will minimize credit card losses and defaults by 20% and predict credit card usage level within a range of 15% to improve credit card profitability within 3 months of implementation.
## The Data:
The Kaggle website hosts the original credit card datasets in their website as one of their competitions. Here, I downloaded the data from the Kaggle website. Following are the data fields in the dataset, which we are going to read in the Pandas data frame after a number of data transformations are made since data is very rarely ready for use without data cleaning up and standarding. The data wrangling and preprocessing steps are setting the missing values to their mean or median values for the respective columns as well as setting outliers to the mean. There were also some re-scaling of numerical data and the target Y credit scores had to be converted from text to numeric with values 1 = Poor, 2 = Standard, 3 = Good.
